# MERN-skeleton

This is a basic MERN application built as a means to quickly have a starting foundation for any mern projects. This is meant to be used as a template for future projects as well as a model for people learning about full stack mern apps.

This is my first fully built MERN app. I have typically used SERN and wanted to experiemnt with mongoDb and mongoose. The app is split into two folders. Client and server. For the new devs looking at this, it is split so that our server application is run seperatelty from the client side. It is easier to get through and read in this format. It also allows for two devs to work on either project simultaniously without conflict. From what I gather this seems to be best practice. 

The server side of the project is using mongoose (mongoDb) as well as express to create the server. I tried to include many of the CRUD operations as well as linking fields in the user and game databases. I also included an example of middleware within the app. 

The client side is a react app. I used alot of the most common react hooks including useState, and useEffect as well as react-router-dom with some of its functionality. 

Please feel free to fork this brnach and use it as a starting point for your next MERN app.
